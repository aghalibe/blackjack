refactor the blackjack exercise into a package with an exported AI anyone can implement to
create a bot that plays blackjack in a simulated game.
there are two packages - main and -blackjack, where main contains the AI implementation and 
will start the game, while blackjack contains the AI interface as well as all the (mostly) hidden logic to run the blackjack game,
based on decisions made by the AI.
